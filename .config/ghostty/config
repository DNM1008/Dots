# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /home/zeus/.config/ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
# 
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
# 
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
# 
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
# 
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
# 
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
# 
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
# 
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
# 
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
# 
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:rose-pine-dawn,dark:rose-pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
# 
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
# 
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.
# 
theme = catppuccin-macchiato 

# Configure a preference for window decorations. This setting specifies
# a _preference_; the actual OS, desktop environment, window manager, etc.
# may override this preference. Ghostty will do its best to respect this
# preference but it may not always be possible.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#   * `none` - All window decorations will be disabled. Titlebar,
#     borders, etc. will not be shown. On macOS, this will also disable
#     tabs (enforced by the system).
# 
#   * `auto` - Automatically decide to use either client-side or server-side
#     decorations based on the detected preferences of the current OS and
#     desktop environment. This option usually makes Ghostty look the most
#     "native" for your desktop.
# 
#   * `client` - Prefer client-side decorations.
# 
#   * `server` - Prefer server-side decorations. This is only relevant
#     on Linux with GTK, either on X11, or Wayland on a compositor that
#     supports the `org_kde_kwin_server_decoration` protocol (e.g. KDE Plasma,
#     but almost any non-GNOME desktop supports this protocol).
# 
#     If `server` is set but the environment doesn't support server-side
#     decorations, client-side decorations will be used instead.
# 
# The default value is `auto`.
# 
# For the sake of backwards compatibility and convenience, this setting also
# accepts boolean true and false values. If set to `true`, this is equivalent
# to `auto`. If set to `false`, this is equivalent to `none`.
# This is convenient for users who live primarily on systems that don't
# differentiate between client and server-side decorations (e.g. macOS and
# Windows).
# 
# The "toggle_window_decorations" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime. This will always toggle
# back to "auto" if the current value is "none" (this is an issue
# that will be fixed in the future).
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.
window-decoration = none

# Horizontal window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells
# and the left and right window borders. The value is in points, meaning that
# it will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-x = 2` will set both paddings to 2.
window-padding-x = 10

# Vertical window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and
# the top and bottom window borders. The value is in points, meaning that it
# will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different top and bottom padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-y = 2,4` will set the
# top padding to 2 and the bottom padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-y = 2` will set both paddings to 2.
window-padding-y = 10

# The viewport dimensions are usually not perfectly divisible by the cell
# size. In this case, some extra padding on the end of a column and the bottom
# of the final row may exist. If this is `true`, then this extra padding
# is automatically balanced between all four edges to minimize imbalance on
# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
# 
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still
# apply. The other padding is applied first and may affect how many grid cells
# actually exist, and this is applied last in order to balance the padding
# given a certain viewport size and grid cell size.
window-padding-balance = false

# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# 
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
font-family = JetBrains Mono Nerd Font

# Duration (in seconds) of the quick terminal enter and exit animation.
# Set it to 0 to disable animation completely. This can be changed at
# runtime.
quick-terminal-animation-duration = 0
